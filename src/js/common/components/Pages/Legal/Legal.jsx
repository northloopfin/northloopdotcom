Unauthorized Transfers. Tell us at once if you believe your Card or North Loop Checking Account information (such as any personal identification number or password) is lost or stolen or has been or may be subject to unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers. Contact us immediately at help@nolobank.com to keep your possible losses to a minimum. You can cancel your Card in app on the Checking Account page. You could lose all the money in your North Loop Checking Account. If you tell us within 2 business days after learning of the loss or theft of your Card or North Loop Checking Account information, or after learning of any other unauthorized transfers from your account involving your Card or North Loop Checking Account information, you can lose no more than $50 if Electronic Fund Transfers are made without your permission. For these transactions, if you DO NOT tell us within 2 business days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use, and we can establish that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfers if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your periodic account statement shows unauthorized transfers and you DO NOT tell us within 60 days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lose after the 60 day period if we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfers if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of a suspected lost or stolen Card or North Loop Checking Account information or of any other suspected unauthorized transfers, the time periods specified in this Subsection may be extended for a reasonable period.</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size: 13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:#585757'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size: 13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:#585757'>Error Resolution. </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size: 13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:#585757'>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='background:white'><span lang=EN style='font-size: 13.0pt;line-height:115%;color:#585757'>1.
